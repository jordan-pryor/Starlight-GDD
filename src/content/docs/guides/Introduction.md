## Introduction

Welcome to the Starlight Game Design Documentation! This document provides a comprehensive overview of Starlight, an open-world RPG / FPS Pseudo-MMO that invites players to explore a richly detailed universe shaped by cosmic events and advanced technology. Below, you'll find an introduction to the storyline, setting, and key gameplay features that define the Starlight experience.

### Storyline & Setting

#### Storyline

The story of Starlight unfolds in the aftermath of the Second Renaissance, a golden age of technological and societal advancement abruptly ended by a cosmic disaster known as the Cataclysm. This catastrophic event was triggered by a fail-safe from the Elyndari, a mysterious precursor race, unleashing widespread chaos. As a result, humanity's advanced technology faltered, leading to environmental collapse, celestial disturbances, and alien invasions.

Players step into the shoes of the Ascendant, individuals resurrected from death with extraordinary abilities due to cybernetic malfunctions during the Cataclysm. As members of the Eternal Order, the Ascendant are dedicated to reclaiming lost glory and rebuilding civilization. With fragmented memories of their past lives and special powers reminiscent of those found in Destiny 2, they embark on a quest for redemption and restoration.

#### Setting

In the shattered remnants of a once-great civilization, Starlight thrusts players into a post-apocalyptic Earth ravaged by cosmic upheavals and advanced technology gone awry. After the Cataclysm, humanity has been reduced to three remaining cities—London, Elysium, and The Boneyard—and isolated colonies scattered across a hostile wasteland. The game features a richly detailed world where nature and technology intertwine, creating a stark contrast between crumbling urban landscapes and lush, overgrown ruins.
