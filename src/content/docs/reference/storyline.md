### Overview

In the wake of global turmoil and environmental collapse during the 21st century, humanity faced its darkest hour. Nations faltered, ecosystems crumbled, and a bleak desolation blanketed the Earth. Amidst this chaos, salvation emerged from the icy depths of Europa, Jupiter's moon. Explorers unearthed the ancient ruins of the Elyndari civilization—a race believed to have been extinct for millennia.

### The Revelation

The Elyndari ruins revealed astounding advancements in technology, architecture, and cosmic understanding. Artifacts uncovered hinted at interstellar travel, energy manipulation, and an intricate grasp of multiple dimensions. The Elyndari's legacy provided a blueprint for humanity’s resurgence. This new era, known as the Second Renaissance, ushered humanity into a period of unprecedented growth. The Sol system was transformed, and humanity's hopes were rekindled.

## The Second Renaissance

During the Second Renaissance, humanity united under the Terra Alliance. Nations pooled resources and knowledge to reverse-engineer Elyndari technology. This collaborative effort led to groundbreaking scientific advancements:

- **Sustainable Energy**: New energy sources emerged, dramatically improving living conditions and reducing reliance on dwindling resources.
- **Advanced Medical Treatments**: Breakthroughs in medicine eradicated many diseases and extended human lifespans.
- **Exploration Beyond Earth**: Enhanced space travel capabilities allowed for the colonization of other planets and moons.

Elysium, a monumental mega-city built upon the ruins of New York, became humanity’s new center of power. The city’s neon-lit skyline contrasted sharply with the poverty-stricken lower levels. It was governed by a council representing all surviving nations, tasked with maintaining order and security.

## The Cataclysm

Prosperity was short-lived. Prophetic visions, believed to be echoes of the Elyndari’s warning, forewarned of a looming cosmic threat. On December 31, 2200, the Cataclysm began. Humanity accidentally activated a fail-safe embedded in their technology from The Precursors, alerting them to the existence of another highly advanced race. This fail-safe unleashed a catastrophic chain reaction, causing the Precursors to re-activate the Singularity leading to:

- **Technological Collapse**: Advanced systems across the globe were dismantled, causing widespread chaos.
- **Cosmic/Galactic Havoc**: Celestial collisions and solar upheavals ravaged worlds and any star-bound entities.
- **Environmental Ruin**: Mutated wildlife, environmental degradation, and alien invasions plagued Earth.

By January 1, 2212, humanity was reduced to three remaining cities:

- **London**: A fortress city focused on survival and isolation. Heavily fortified, it operates under a strict regime that controls resource distribution. Its inhabitants live under constant surveillance, with a divided society where the elite enjoy relative comfort while the masses struggle to survive.
- **Elysium**: A sprawling mega-city with a neon-lit facade and internal strife. The city is divided into sectors controlled by various factions. The lower levels are rife with poverty and crime, while the elite reside in fortified towers above the chaos.
- **The Boneyard** (formerly Los Angeles): A sprawling urban jungle struggling against external threats. Surrounded by fortified walls, it is protected from rogue AI units and hostile raiders. Inside, it is a patchwork of high-tech zones and slums.

## Colonies and Vaults

### Colonies

Outside the mega-cities, isolated human colonies struggle to survive in the wasteland. Hidden and protected by makeshift defenses, these colonies rely on scavenging and face constant threats from rogue AI and raiders. Trust is rare, and survival is a daily challenge.

### Secret Vaults on Colony Planets

Scattered throughout the solar system, these hidden vaults preserve the last remnants of humanity’s golden age. Containing invaluable knowledge and technology from the Second Renaissance, they remain dormant, awaiting discovery by those courageous enough to seek them out.

## The Wasteland

The post-apocalyptic Earth is a stark juxtaposition of advanced technology and natural reclamation. Ruined skyscrapers, overgrown with vines, stand as silent sentinels over a desolate landscape. The remnants of advanced technology lay scattered and rusting, while the sky remains a perpetual gray, intermittently illuminated by flashes of lightning.

## Present Day

Amid the chaos of the post-Cataclysm world, a new chapter begins. Those affected by the fail-safe—whose cybernetics malfunctioned and caused their deaths—are resurrected. These individuals, now imbued with special abilities akin to those found in Destiny 2 and rendered effectively immortal, are known as the Ascendant. They form the Eternal Order, a collective dedicated to helping humanity reclaim its lost glory.

Initially, the Ascendant have no memories of their past lives but can recover fragments through various experiences and interactions. As they navigate the fractured world, they strive to rebuild civilization and uncover the remnants of their former lives. Their mission marks the beginning of "Starlight," a quest for redemption and restoration in a galaxy marred by cosmic strife and ancient enigmas.
